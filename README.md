crypto first, other flat currencies comes later. we can build a distributed relay framework later upon Blockchain.

openmule can either relay traffic between CUA servers (ai controller) and clients (command receivers, executors), pay bills to servers, or host its own servers by putting all config files to openmule server.

---

openmule can probe connection health to clients and servers

---

can control user defined remote machine, cloud machine, openmule hosted machine or remote openmule client

openmule shall provide top security to end users, by eliminating intranet network address access.

---

the user shall have a webui interface to virtualized machine which is being controlled, with a password, to configure cua connection details and view logs, and a dialogue to confirm if this machine is bare metal without virtualization, if so then any keyboard or mouse movement will trigger emergency stop, or some other action like moving mouse to a specific corner
